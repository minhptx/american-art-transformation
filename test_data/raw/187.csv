"These portraits [see also 1946.37.M] of a wealthy merchant and his wife were painted in Philadelphia, where the debt-ridden Gilbert Stuart had relocated from Great Britain to recoup his fortune by painting George Washington's portrait. Their swirling brushwork, broad handling, variety of textures, and, in particular, luscious flesh tones were all trademarks of Stuart's style-and light years ahead of any other American artist at the time.

Philadelphians such as the Ashleys flocked to Stuart, as did sitters during his later stays in the new city of Washington, D.C., and Boston. Unfortunately, Stuart was famously slow to complete his commissions, thus America's most skilled artist remained perpetually broke. object/3041171"

"The portrait of Captain John Pratt owes much to the biographies of both the sitter and the artist. The paper Pratt prominently brandishes in his left hand is his commission from George Washington as captain of the First Regiment of the United States Army. On his Continental Army uniform, he wears a medal indicating membership in the Society of the Cincinnati, a then-elitist group of veterans. The viewer is thus reminded both of Pratt's past and his continuing service to his newly founded country.

Conversely, the structure in the background-the Middletown, Connecticut, town hall-is a compositional reminder of Ralph Earl's own history and artistic loyalties. Although linked with the portraits Earl painted in Connecticut, the motif is borrowed from topographical landscape paintings of British country houses, which Earl discovered while in England from 1778 to 1785 (loyal to the British cause, Earl left America after the end of the Revolution). Furthermore, the somewhat flat effect of the figure of Pratt relates to Earl's rejection of the painterly effects of British portraiture, even while he adopted its background details and full-length format.

"Huddie ,Leadbelly, Ledbetter (1885-1949) achieved fame in the northeastern U.S. for his folk songs and for his reputation as a violent, two-time murderer whose music supposedly earned him a pardon from the governor of Texas. His music later influenced both folk singers and rock performers as diverse as Janis Joplin and Pearl Jam.

Dallas native Michael Owen met the elderly musician in New York. As he remembered, ,Leadbelly sat for me one afternoon and I finished the clay model at that time. From that I worked out the stone cutting, only being able to work on it in my spare time. All in all it was about a full month's work, I guess. During the time he was 'sitting' for me (playing his guitar and singing) he played 'Goodnight, Irene,' but at that time the folk music devotees did not consider the tune 'true folk music.' Still it pleased me when it became a popular song. It's too bad Leadbelly couldn't have lived to see himself gain such popularity., object/3058187"

"A radiant crown of bright sunbeams draws our eyes toward the fierce gaze of the handsome, beardless Sun god, Helios. The ancient poet Homer described how the mighty titan Helios ,shines upon men and deathless gods, and piercingly he gazes with his eyes from his golden helmet. Bright rays beam dazzlingly from him, and his bright locks streaming from the temples of his head gracefully enclose his far-seen face.,

Donald De Lue translated Homer's verse into sculptural form using a theme that appealed to his lifelong fascination with ancient Greek and Roman mythology. This figure is one of the artist's most beautiful early sculptures. It marks a turning point in De Lue's working method, as it is the last one that he modeled in French clay and cast in plaster himself.

"John Singer Sargent painted this study of a Spanish dancer as he was beginning work on a monumental painting of a flamenco performance, titled El Jaleo. He had witnessed flamenco firsthand in the cafes of Seville when he traveled to Spain in 1879, and after returning to Paris he spent three years exploring the subject. In his study of this dancer, her dramatic gesture and swirling, fringed shawl convey her movement. Sargent sketched the basic forms in pencil before deftly applying watercolor washes to give substance to the dancer's body and shawl, and to suggest the murky background.

Sargent painted this subject during the Golden Age of Flamenco (1860-1915), when this improvisational form of gypsy dancing became a popular theatrical spectacle. Flamenco is generally performed by a solo dancer to the accompaniment of a guitarist, singer, and palmero, who provides percussion with handclaps.

Though flamenco is usually associated today with a loud, rhythmic stamping of the heels, when Sargent saw flamenco performed in the late 19th century, it would have been only the male dancers who stamped their feet. Female dancers, such as the one shown here, only brushed their feet across the dance floor; their performance relied instead on the movements of their upper body and emphatic gestures to create drama. object/3095662"

",The human subject is the most important thing. My work is abstract in the sense of having been designed and composed, but it is not abstract in the sense of having no human content. . . . [I] want to communicate. I want the idea to stick right away.,-Jacob Lawrence

Family members have come to call on a severely ill relative. Each visitor expresses concern or grief in a different way as a preacher offers a final blessing in the far bedroom. Jacob Lawrence uses views through doorways and windows to enrich the narrative. Many of his works are about the lives of ordinary Americans and are often based on his keen observations of daily life in the tenements of Harlem, where he came of age. Lawrence was the first black artist represented by a New York gallery and one of the greatest African-American talents of the 20th century. object/3096506"

"Catfish Row in Charleston, South Carolina, became famous as the setting of George Gershwin’s 1934 opera, ,Porgy & Bess,, about a crippled beggar and his love in a predominantly African American community. Although George Biddle initially visited Charleston in June 1930, making a number of ink sketches that he later developed into oil paintings and lithographs, the title of the lithograph and its 1936 release date suggest that Gershwin’s immensely popular opera influenced the choice of subject.

Biddle, one of the masterminds behind the creation of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), favored regional scenes like Cat Fish Row. Though born in Philadelphia, he had a close connection to Texas, where he spent 1908–09 working as a cowboy. He continued to visit the state often, and in 1940 he settled for a time in San Antonio, where he completed a number of notable drawings, watercolors, and paintings. object/3102529"

"Luxurious blues and greens and loose brushwork capture the ever-changing effects of a field of bluebonnets. This humble state flower of Texas was forever transformed by the brush of San Antonio-born Julian Onderdonk, one of the greatest early Texas artists.

Originally trained by his father, Robert Jenkins Onderdonk, himself an important early Texas painter, Julian Onderdonk studied with William Merritt Chase. Chase stressed the importance of working outdoors and paying close attention to effects of light and shadow. Onderdonk applied these lessons to his native scenery when he returned to Texas around 1909. His enormously popular landscapes spawned a host of imitators after his early death at age forty; however, none of them ever equaled Onderdonk's use of the Texas landscape as a way of investigating the dynamic experience of nature itself. object/3140450"

Like many other artists of his generation, Weeks left America for France, where he studied in Paris with the famed painters Jean–Léon Gérôme and Léon Bonnat. From them, he absorbed a realist style combined with a strong sense of color. After travels to Spain and North Africa, Weeks journeyed to India in 1882, where he spent three extended stays over the next eleven years. object/3210866"

"When newly rich New Hampshire merchant Woodbury Langdon wanted to commission portraits of himself and his eighteen-year-old wife, Sarah, two years after their marriage, there was no question of any other artist in Boston-indeed, in the colonies-for the job. In a little more than a decade, John Singleton Copley had parlayed a partial artistic education and his own teenage courage and ambition into a dazzlingly successful style. What clients like the Langdons responded to-and what viewers today can still appreciate-was Copley's miraculous way with the rendering of textures. Under his brush, oil paint became hair, flesh, and fabric, which is readily apparent in this pair of portraits. Copley also liberally borrowed costumes and poses from mezzotint engravings, allowing his clients to emulate the fashionable attire and self-presentation of the motherland.

Copley's self-assurance with materials and close attention to detail, however, contrast vividly with his awkwardness with spatial relationships, seen in particular in the proportions of Woodbury Langdon's right arm or in the difference in scale between Sarah Langdon's head and shoulders. Such difficulties were due to Copley's lack of formal training. While he deplored this as a condition of being in a provincial environment, generations of art historians-and viewers-have found this to be part of the artist's charm.

Copley left Boston on the eve of the Revolution (his father-in-law was the merchant whose shipments were destroyed during the Boston Tea Party). After travel in Italy, he settled in London with his family, where, with encouragement from expatriate artist Benjamin West, his style became ever more refined. At home, the Langdons prospered, eventually having ten children and obtaining high political and judicial offices. object/3214606"

"This portrait of George Bellows' wife, Emma Story, took over three years to produce and involved just as much dramatic struggle as the artist's well-known fight scenes. As Mrs. Bellows later wrote, ,I remember the terrific struggle George had with the head. He scraped it out again and again. Finally one day he said 'get up on the model stand and I'll have another try.' I said, 'Well-you had better make it snappy, this dress will not hold out much longer.' That afternoon everything worked together for good-the head just flew on-and the painting was finished., The Museum also possesses a preparatory drawing by Bellows of the dress itself.

A member of the Eight, or Ashcan school, and best known for his boxing scenes, George Bellows also produced moving portraits, as seen here.

"The American artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler is generally credited with spurring the Etching Revival, an artistic movement that flourished in Britain and France during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The artists of the Etching Revival sought to renew etching as a form of original artistic expression rather than mere reproduction. Their graphic work not only looked back to the open, painterly style of Rembrandt and his generation but demonstrated a modern sensibility in the choice of subject matter.

"“The artist discovers beauty and meaning in whatever environment he is cast by chance,” Isaac Soyer wrote in 1947, “for no matter where he is born and grows up, his life work is set for him, to glorify and describe intimately and sympathetically, the people and the physical appearance of everything around him.” The bustle of a busy day in a beauty parlor animates this dynamic New York scene by Soyer, who concentrated on life in the city during the early 20th century.The painter used childhood friends as models for the man in the background at right and the woman in front getting a manicure.The hubbub of human activities competes with the dramatic patterned tile floor for the viewer’s attention. object/3233442"

"During the summer of 1927, Edward Hopper discovered the Two Lights lighthouse in Cape Elizabeth, Maine. Over the course of three years, he would paint the lighthouse twice. For Hopper, the play of sunlight and shadow across the buildings offered rich formal possibilities, which he exploited in a brilliant blue sky and strong contrast between light and dark.

Perhaps one of the most enigmatic of modern American artists, Hopper created indelible images of the American scene, both urban and rural. His quiet, brooding paintings evoke both the isolation and exposure associated with modern life. object/3233927"

Gertrude Murray was the sister of Samuel Murray, a younger Philadelphia sculptor who was one of the artist’s staunchest friends and with whom he shared studio space. As is typical in his extraordinarily moving late portraits, Eakins has isolated his sitter against a neutral background, showing her absorbed in thought.

Referring to this work, Burchfield himself said, ,For me the `picture' was the grim dramatic quality of the buildings in the eerie light of an imminent storm., ,Street Scene, depicts a box-gatherer pulling his cart down Genesee Street on a day in early spring.  The scene derives a surreal quality from the giant trade signs of a molar and a pair of shears, and the ,false-front, effect of the central structure.

",River Nocturne,, done on the brown paper James McNeill Whistler favored for his pastels, was made while Whistler was working on his 1877 ,Nocturnes, series of paintings based on views of the Thames at night. Beginning in 1866, Whistler began to use musical nomenclature for his titles. These musical designations were meant to suggest the analogy between the visual arts and the abstract art of music. He felt that art should be independent, purely aesthetically pleasing without the confusion caused by specific emotions or reminiscences. He often used titles like ,Arrangement,, ,Harmony,, and, in this case, ,Nocturne,, to distance his works from specific themes. object/3268204"

"Thomas M. Stell, Jr.'s intense interest in design is evident in the bold, hard-edged contours of his young sitter's body and the highly ornate background.The stillness and frozen quality of the composition recall the artist's reverence for early Italian and Northern Renaissance paintings, which he saw during his European studies. Stell brought reproductions of these works back to Dallas, opening up new artistic avenues for his colleagues in the Dallas Nine.The directness of his portraiture is also indebted to the example of two of his New York teachers, George Luks and Charles Webster Hawthorne. A similarly penetrating portrait by Hawthorne is on view nearby.

"Jerry Bywaters was an important voice in the arts in Texas, having trained in Dallas and in the East with Robert Vonnoh, Bruce Crane, and John Sloan.  He was a founder of the Dallas Artists League, editor of the magazine ,Southwestern Arts,, a critic for the ,Dallas Morning News,, and director of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts from 1942 until his retirement in 1964.  While many regional artists in the prewar years were painting nostalgic anecdotal visions of America, Bywaters took a different tack.  Like a ,memento mori, still life of an earlier century, ,On the Ranch, is an eerie assemblage of detritus cataloguing the history of Texas--from the American Indian symbolized by the arrowhead, to the gunslinger, the cowpoke, the rancher who fenced in the range, and the vanished inhabitants of Bywaters's own time, driven from the ranch perhaps by the blows of depression and drought. object/3272857"

"Although painted in London, this set of elegant portraits [with 1993.76] of a young pair of British aristocrats displays all the traits that would make Scottish-born John Smibert the leading painter in colonial America after he immigrated to the New World in 1729.The artist presents Edward and Eleanor Nightingale as confident, young, attractive, and fashionable, from Eleanor’s glistening silk wrapper to Edward’s relaxed Turkish robe and headdress (18th-century gentlemen left their powdered wigs off at home or among friends). Smibert trained in the studio of Sir Godfrey Kneller, leading court painter of the early 18th-century. From him, he mastered the conventions of high society portraiture, shown here not just by the Nightingales’ informal dress but also by their poses, as well as the background accessories that situate them as cultured sitters.

Smibert came to America inadvertently. Persuaded to join the faculty of a projected missionary college in Bermuda, he made it as far as Rhode Island when royal funds for the institution never materialized. Smibert settled in Boston, where his influence as the first fully professionally trained artist in America had far-reaching effects. Not only did other artists soon imitate Smibert’s compositions but the copies of old masters he had intended to use as teaching resources in the abortive school—as well as his other studio contents—exposed a generation of young native-born artists to examples of European art. object/3283542"

"When it first entered the Dallas Museum of Art’s collection in 1931, this painting was believed to be a work by the hand of Asher B. Durand, a leading figure of the first generation of Hudson River school painters. Given Durand’s reverential and naturalistic portrayal of landscapes over his entire career, and the acknowledged impact he had on the early works of the young painter George Inness, it is possible to understand how this unsigned work was mistaken as a creation by the older artist. Yet, at some unrecorded point prior to 1974, the authorship was questioned and the painting’s status was downgraded to possibly being by Durand—a classification that held fast until August of 2012. 

Because of the questionable authorship, the painting was relegated to storage for many years. Recently, the strength of the composition and its competent execution compelled a curator to embark on a concerted exploration of the work. Through a close comparison of salient factors, including paint application and the execution of details such as foliage and rocks, she eliminated various artists as the potential creator; however, close scrutiny of early works by George Inness yielded the greatest degree of parity in matters of execution. Suddenly, and quite unexpectedly, she spied a delicate and unassuming pen-and-ink drawing with touches of gouache (illustrated below) that contained the key compositional elements of the Dallas work—the most eye-catching being the pointing trapezoidal rock that appears in the center of both drawing and painting.

The discovery of the relationship between the compositional study and the painting allows us a rare opportunity to observe Inness’s artistic process at a period (c. 1850) for which few such pairings exist. Particularly fascinating to observe is the artist’s translation of a vertical compositional study into an expansive horizontal format wherein the key features are fully maintained. Historically, the painting also falls into a period (1848– 51) when the artist combined the vestiges of Durand’s naturalism with the sculptural aspects of Dutch landscape painting. Inness’s painting style changed radically again with his first trip to Europe in 1851. 

Since the title for the painting prior to this discovery ( ,In the Woods,) most likely was not Inness’s, a new title that reflects stylistically those used by him at that period has been assigned— ,Stream in the Mountains,. object/3285168"

"Executed by Benjamin West and probably several of his students shortly before his death, this painting is a late example of a religious theme that the artist had begun exploring in 1790.The composition likely relates to Matthew 18:1-4 in the Christian New Testament: ,At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven., A large-scale treatment of the subject by West still hangs in the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children foundling hospital in London, and its popularity doubtless created demand among private collectors for smaller examples such as this one. object/3287498"

"“Time and Tide “is considered Alfred Thompson Bricher’s finest painting. In its title and mood it reflects the shift toward literary and psychologically potent themes in landscape painting toward the end of the 19th century. Shortly after the end of the Civil War, the vogue for the grand landscapes painted by Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt gave way to a preference for a more introspective vision of the American land. Literary allusions that viewers would recognize immediately became popular in titles for paintings, reflecting that generation’s emphasis on the written word. Bricher was an avid reader, and for “Time and Tide “he drew on a line from Sir Walter Scott’s “The Antiquary “of 1816: “Time and tide tarry for no man,” recast in 1843 by Charles Dickens in “Martin Chuzzlewit “to read, “Time and tide will wait for no man, saith the adage, but all men have to wait for time and tide.” object/3289029"

Doel Reed takes advantage of the medium’s painterly character to produce a variety of lines and textures, particularly in his rendering of the foliage on the trees.

Originally from Indiana, Doel Reed first went to Europe while serving in World War I, and returned several times throughout his life. He is considered a master of aquatint and is best known for his landscapes of Taos, New Mexico, where he had retired after teaching art at Oklahoma State University.

His depiction of consumer products-particularly the recently invented safety razor-precedes the later use of commercial imagery by pop artists of the 1960s.

Murphy was a member of the Lost Generation, the group of artistically minded Americans who colonized Paris between the two world wars. His exposure to modern art at gallery exhibitions-and subsequent friendships with Pablo Picasso, Fernand Léger, and Igor Stravinsky-convinced him to become a painter himself. After studying with the Russian painter and designer Natalia Goncharova, Murphy embarked upon a short-lived career.

"Jerry Bywaters' ,Share Cropper, is a tribute to the hardscrabble dust farmers of northern Texas. The stark, severe gaze and simplified forms evoke the same dignity and forthrightness of works by a fellow regionalist, Iowa-based Grant Wood. The painting also reflects the vivid-even harsh-realism of broader influences such as the German New Objectivity of the earlier 20th century.

The impact of Jerry Bywaters upon the Dallas art world is almost impossible to describe briefly. He was a founding member of the Lone Star Printmakers; an editor of Southwestern Arts; a professor at his alma mater, Southern Methodist University; and director of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts for twenty-one years. Bywaters made, encouraged, acquired, and influenced much of the art that defined the city.

"When newly rich New Hampshire merchant Woodbury Langdon wanted to commission portraits of himself and his eighteen-year-old wife, Sarah, two years after their marriage, there was no question of any other artist in Boston-indeed, in the colonies-for the job. In a little more than a decade, John Singleton Copley had parlayed a partial artistic education and his own teenage courage and ambition into a dazzlingly successful style. What clients like the Langdons responded to-and what viewers today can still appreciate-was Copley's miraculous way with the rendering of textures.

Copley's self-assurance with materials and close attention to detail, however, contrast vividly with his awkwardness with spatial relationships, seen in particular in the proportions of Woodbury Langdon's right arm or in the difference in scale between Sarah Langdon's head and shoulders. Such difficulties were due to Copley's lack of formal training. While he deplored this as a condition of being in a provincial environment, generations of art historians-and viewers-have found this to be part of the artist's charm.

"The American artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler is generally credited with spurring the Etching Revival, an artistic movement that flourished in Britain and France during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The artists of the Etching Revival sought to renew etching as a form of original artistic expression rather than mere reproduction. Their graphic work not only looked back to the open, painterly style of Rembrandt and his generation but demonstrated a modern sensibility in the choice of subject matter.

In the 1880s, Whistler's etchings and drypoints tended to be smaller and simpler, with less fine detail and surface tone than his earlier prints. His prints of this decade are characterized by abbreviated, expressive lines. Whistler's last etchings showcase his command of the medium with richness and variety. object/4005593"

"Painted about five years into Mary Trusler's second marriage, her portrait reveals Jeremiah Theus's direct observation of his Charlestonian sitter, her desire for elegant representation, and his own stylistic difficulties. Theus, who had immigrated to South Carolina from Switzerland with his family as a teenager, relied heavily on the use of engravings for his portrait compositions. The placement of the sitter in an oval opening was typical in such prints. The luxurious satin dress Mary Trusler wears was also taken directly from an engraved source, shown by the contrast between its hard-edged, uniformly lit folds and the much more sensitively modeled face of his thirtyish sitter. The elaborate bow on Mary Trusler's lace fichu and the string of pearls around her neck are devices Theus used in many of his portraits to bridge the gap between what was real and what was borrowed from artistic sources-often with his sitters' full compliance. object/4006006"

"Like much of Hildegarde Haas’s work, Fog is a landscape that has been abstracted into its basic formal elements. Vegetation is represented through fields of textured color, and trees have been reduced to black lines. Incidentally, the trees also resemble musical notes on a staff, reflecting Haas’s interest in music. She considered her work to be synesthetic in nature, equating sounds with color and forms.

Born in Frankfurt, Germany, Haas studied art at the Art Students League in New York, where she encountered the abstract compositions of German and Russian modernism. Initially a painter, Haas taught herself to make woodblock prints. She exhibited her work with other New York printmakers before relocating to California. object/4013465"

"The circular forms of Arthur Dove's early experiments in abstraction combine with brilliant, varied colors, expressing his highly personal response both to nature and to the nature of painting. Produced during his last, difficult year in Geneva, New York, where he had moved in 1933 to settle his parents' estate, this small painting exemplifies Dove's mature style. 

Dove was one of the earliest American artists to commit totally to abstraction, which he did after spending two years in France, where he absorbed both the colors and the increasingly nonrepresentational forms of Paul Cézanne and Henri Matisse. His friendship with photographer and art impresario Alfred Stieglitz resulted in exposure at Stieglitz's influential galleries An American Place and 291, which helped attract young American artists to abstraction. object/4024975"
"Rich and diverse colors interact with ivory black silhouettes, creating movement and depth in Charles Demuth’s ,Zinnias., Despite the beautiful effect, however, this is not just a floral study but rather an expression of emotion through floral forms. Arguably the finest watercolorist of the 20th century, Demuth painted everything from landscape abstractions to lively circus and vaudeville scenes. He began stylized floral paintings such as this one after 1915. Demuth’s handling of the floral genre may have influenced Georgia O’Keeffe’s explorations of this subject. object/4025059"
"This boldly painted portrait is characteristic of the vigorous style of the forty-year artistic partnership of Samuel Lovett Waldo and William Jewett. After training at the Royal Academy in London from 1806 to 1809,Waldo returned to the U.S. and began a successful career as a portraitist and cultural figure in New York. Jewett-formerly apprenticed to a coach-maker-was first Waldo's apprentice and then his eventual employee and partner.While Waldo usually painted his subjects' heads and shoulders, Jewett normally concentrated on backgrounds.

"Vaucluse, in the southern French region of Provence, was the final home of the Italian poet Petrarch, one of the first great Renaissance writers. In 1841, on his second European tour,Thomas Cole memorialized Petrarch's home in this grandiose canvas, worked up in Rome from sketches done on-site. Once in the studio, he exaggerated the scale of the cliffs in this scene to magnify the drama, and he reconstructed Petrarch's castle, which in actuality lay in ruins.

Although he founded the Hudson River school, the group of loosely affiliated American artists who took inspiration from the natural landscapes outside of the northeastern urban centers, Cole also painted several European scenes such as this one.

"Bisttram immigrated to the United States in 1902 and studied at the National Academy of Design before joining the artists' colony at Taos in 1931.  The following year he established the Taos School of Fine Arts, where, in the years leading up to the Second World War, Bisttram advocated a form of abstract painting based on an intellectual formula of ,dynamic symmetry,, popularized by Canadian theoretician Jay Hambidge.  The early works from Taos depict the native population in a representational style and reflect Bisttram's training as a graphic artist.  The simple forms and strong linear quality of ,Pueblo Woman, also recall the great Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, with whom Bisttram briefly studied. object/4095946"

"While the jewel–like colors and simplified forms may make this beach seem otherworldly, the painting is rooted in one of Maurice Prendergast's favorite places: the Massachusetts coast. Although an American scene, the choice of subject matter and abstract style are due to the influence of European modernism, which Prendergast absorbed through several years' study in Paris, as well as on trips to Italy.

This work dates from the period when Prendergast began to exhibit with the Eight, a group of American artists who were dissatisfied with official juried exhibitions and decided to mount their own independent shows. He also participated in the landmark 1913 Armory Show, the exhibition that first exposed mass American artists and viewers to modernism.

"The Green River Valley in Wyoming was a site dear to Thomas Moran's heart. He painted this subject nearly forty times after he first encountered it in 1871 on an illustration commission for ,Scribner's, magazine. In this late example, nostalgia has informed Moran's memories, creating a landscape that is a blend of fantasy and reality. The shimmering mountain range of Toll Rock rising out of the mist recalls Moran's numerous scenes of Venice and stands in opposition to the often harsh environmental contrasts of the actual American West. And by 1911, when Moran gave the painting its poignant title, the Native American riders advancing into the landscape had long vanished with the dominance of Anglo-American culture after statehood in 1890. object/4110584"

In these scenes, Haskell juxtaposes the massive scale of the trees with scrupulous detail, demonstrating his interest in mastering the technical aspects of etching.

Initially a newspaper illustrator and poster designer, Haskell took up etching after meeting the famous artist and etcher James Abbott McNeill Whistler during a trip to Europe. Haskell preferred working in a traditional, naturalistic manner, using the meticulous styles of Albrecht Dürer, Leonardo da Vinci, and other old masters to render American subjects and scenes.

"Although Hogue was born in Missouri, his family moved to Denton, Texas, when he was six weeks old. During the 1930s, he taught art in Dallas, and in 1932 he helped found the Dallas Artists League. He was a driving force behind arts advocacy, yet he was one of the few artists of the period who did not work for the WPA. Scorning the Regionalist label, Hogue denied the cheery face of American Scene painting favored by the Federal Arts administrators; more importantly, he refused to ennoble the element of human misery prevalent in so many dust-bowl images. Hogue blamed the region’s problems on man’s inept and thoughtless overcultivation of the land, and viewed the plow as the principal agent of the disaster. In his words, prime grazing lands had been destroyed “first by fence, then by overplowing, now by drought.” Between 1933 and 1936, Hogue worked on a series of six paintings he called his Erosion series, examining variations on this theme.

In ,Drouth Stricken Area,, one of his Erosion paintings, the formerly verdant landscape has been sculpted into sand dunes by the dry, hot wind. Under a searing hot sky, a starving cow waits numbly for water that will not come; perched on the rickety well, an equally patient buzzard awaits the cow’s inevitable death. The only movement in this arid landscape is the dust massing on the horizon, an ominous portent. Hogue deliberately intensified the conditions in his paintings in order to generate empathy within his viewers for the desert-like condition. He called this approach psychoreality. Similar to Stendahl’s Syndrome (in which viewers overcome by a work of art act out the emotions portrayed in the painting or sculpture), Hogue’s psychoreality was meant to draw attention to the actual conditions in the Midwest. Drawings for the emaciated cow and the windmill, also in the Dallas Museum of Art’s collections, affirm the artist’s careful, deliberate abstraction of each component of the painting. In doing so, Hogue sacrificed naturalistic detail in order to achieve the emotional keynote of the landscape. object/4134413"

As he later remembered, ,My mother was dying of cancer in a little room on Lexington Avenue. I was sitting talking to her in the window, and I looked at her face and I said, 'Mother, I've never seen anyone with such beautiful eyes....I'd like to paint you.' So she walked over to her little couch-bed, lay down, and crossed her hands over the pain, as she often did, and I got out my paints and went to work.,

"Bess Bigham Hubbard found inspiration for her works in the native Indian populations of the Southwest, of which this model is a notable example. Hubbard adopted the carving method of her instructor, the famed modernist sculptor William Zorach. Zorach advocated a direct, reductive chiseling method of working, rather than casting a sculpture in metal from a mold. Originally trained in painting and etching, Fort Worth-born and Lubbock-based Hubbard began, in the mid-1940s, to concentrate on sculpture. object/4169914"

",The Icebergs, is Frederic Edwin Church's masterpiece. The seductively inviting colors, glowing subterranean light, and glossy, tactile surfaces of the icebergs attract the viewer's eye. Yet in reality, the scene is an inhospitable place filled with danger, as the broken mast in the foreground indicates.

When it was first exhibited at a Civil War fundraising exhibition, critics hailed it as ,the most splendid work of art that has yet been produced in this country., Both sides of the Atlantic thrilled to this dramatic scene, which was based on sketches made by the artist during a monthlong chartered boat trip in the North Atlantic, off the Canadian coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador.

After its successful exhibition in England, ,The Icebergs, was purchased by Sir William Edward Watkin, a railroad baron. Its subsequent history is almost as dramatic as the scene it represents: largely forgotten, the painting eventually wound up in the collection of an English school before being triumphantly rediscovered. It broke all American art records at auction in the 1970s, when it was purchased and donated to the Dallas Museum of Art by an anonymous benefactor. object/4171219"

"In Greek mythology, the Three Fates were goddesses who determined the course of human lives, represented by lengths of thread. Clotho spun the thread of life, Lachesis determined its length, and Atropos cut the cord. One of several versions of the subject begun by Susan MacDowell Eakins around 1881, this sketch may have originally been intended as the design for a theatrical backdrop at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. It appears to have been cut down from a larger canvas that contained a nude sketch of a woman, possibly by Thomas Eakins.

Susan MacDowell was already an accomplished exhibiting photographer when she began studying with Thomas Eakins at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1880. She soon became one of his closest students and ultimately his wife in 1884. After her marriage, Eakins devoted more time to defending her often-controversial husband than her artistic career, ultimately crafting his legacy through gifts of art and selective collaboration with early biographers. In recent years, Susan Eakins' own works have received increasing scholarly attention. object/4174628"

"Baby Sequoia is one of many etchings that Ernest Haskell created of Giant Sequoia and other American tree species during the first two decades of the twentieth century. In these scenes, Haskell juxtaposes the massive scale of the trees with scrupulous detail, demonstrating his interest in mastering the technical aspects of etching. Initially a newspaper illustrator and poster designer, Haskell took up etching after meeting the famous artist and etcher James Abbott McNeill Whistler during a trip to Europe.

Haskell preferred working in a traditional, naturalistic manner, using the meticulous styles of Albrecht Dürer, Leonardo da Vinci, and other Old Masters to render American subjects and scenes. He was also interested in modern art, however, and made additional trips abroad in order to study the work of Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and other contemporary artists first–hand. object/4183424"

"Simple curving, branching forms dividing the composition indicate Joseph Stella's allegiance to the principles of abstraction. At the same time, they contain a powerfully personal meaning for the artist, as they give visual form to his childhood memories of the sound of a singing nightingale transforming the sleeping Italian countryside. The artist explored this theme in several subsequent works throughout his career.

Born in Italy, Joseph Stella moved to New York at age nineteen. Although he initially painted scenes of urban life in a manner similar to that of the Ashcan school artists, he was transformed  by the dynamic abstraction of European modernism, which he encountered on a return trip to Italy in 1910-11. object/4209965"

"Thomas Moran usually painted scenes of grand western panoramas such as Yellowstone, but his etchings often depict intimate scenes of the northeastern United States. Passaic Meadows is exemplary of Moran’s more humble subject matter, showing the Newark Meadows in New Jersey, near the artist’s home in Long Island. In addition to his own compositions, Moran created several etchings based off the works of Charles François Daubigny and other artists, helping to disseminate Barbizon scenes and other European landscapes to American audiences.

Moran was a key figure in the Etching Revival in America, paralleling the efforts of European artists such as Charles Émile Jacque to demonstrate etching’s potential as a medium for creative expression. Moran’s etchings also earned him several admirers in England, including the art critic and social thinker John Ruskin. object/4218698"

"Beginning in the 1880s, Mary Cassatt began to investigate themes of mothers and children. This intensely intimate, tightly cropped scene alternates between areas of closely observed naturalism and sketchy, abstracted passages. Cassatt's spatial experimentation, interest in contemporary subject matter, and extraordinary facility with the medium of pastel, led to her being invited to exhibit with the impressionists beginning in 1879.

Cassatt had a tremendous impact upon the development of modern art in both France and America. She tirelessly promoted cutting-edge painting to wealthy American patrons, who made purchases largely on her recommendation. Many of these collections now form the nuclei of the great treasure troves of impressionist art in U.S. museums. object/4225944"

"The low horizon line of this lithograph evokes a sense of vastness, reflecting Edward G. Eisenlohr’s intimate familiarity with Texas topography. A resident of Dallas, Eisenlohr was passionate about depicting local scenery, stating that “if you can’t find a landscape worth painting within ten miles of where you are, no matter where you are, then you shouldn’t be a painter.”

While Eisenlohr championed local subjects, his cultural background and artistic training were unquestionably European. The descendant of German immigrants, Eisenlohr spent a year studying in Switzerland and Germany as an adolescent. He later returned to Germany as an adult, where he studied with artists who had been influenced by the Barbizon school. As a painter, Eisenlohr developed an impressionistic style, but his drawings and prints are distinguished by their meticulous, detailed execution. object/4232388"

"By 1886, Childe Hassam was enjoying artistic success with his atmospheric paintings of Boston street scenes.  That same year he left the United States for three years of study in Paris, where he received a disciplined training at the Academie Julian, and at the same time came under the influence of the Impressionists.  ,Along the Seine, Winter, shares its subject matter with Hassam's earlier works, but shows very clearly the first changes in his style toward the mature Impressionism of his works of the 1880s and early 1900s.  The dark clear colors of the Boston paintings are tempered by the pearlescent light of Paris, which Hassam conveys with a much looser, more fluid brush.  The softness of color and touch echoes the mellow winter ambience of the City of Lights. object/4233357"

The painting's nude figures frolic in a landscape referencing classical mythology, while their sinuous poses pay tribute to the radical gestural movements of modern dance pioneer Isadora Duncan.

Davis exhibited in 1908 with the Eight, the group of painters who broke away from the National Academy of Design to organize their own shows but remained on good terms with the artistic establishment. As a result, he helped organize the 1913 Armory Show in New York, the landmark exhibition that first exposed American artists and audiences to modern art and thus indelibly changed the course of American art history. object/4235649"

"This silkscreen is based on an oil painting Robert Gwathmey completed three years previously. The idea for the original composition came from a year Gwathmey spent on a North Carolina tobacco farm in 1944, creating images of the southern black farmer. The geometric structure calls to mind the patterning in African and African American textiles.

Although Caucasian, Gwathmey often worked with African American themes. From an early age, growing up in a fatherless working-class family, he empathized with working people, both black and white. His years traveling, first in America as a freighter and later in Europe as an artist, emphasized to him the plight of African Americans in the South. object/4236726"

Rather than defining an exact location, Inness evoked the mood of the place, giving his viewers the experience of nature through the ever-shifting effects of light, atmosphere, and season.

"Winslow Homer was an avid fisherman, and, with his brother Charles, he spent many summers in the Adirondacks.  In 1886 the brothers joined what would become the North Woods Club in Minerva, New York, which catered to sport hunters and fishermen.  ,Casting in the Falls, was painted during Homer's summer trip to Minerva in 1889 and is one of nearly thirty watercolors dated to that year.

Homer rarely painted his works on-site, relying instead on rapid pencil sketches and an acute visual memory to guide him in his studio.  For this watercolor the artist places the viewer at the base of the falls, looking upstream at a fisherman in the midst of his cast.  By deliberately rendering the fisherman in broad washes with minimal detail, Homer emphasizes the graceful motion of the cast.  As the fisherman leans back, his body acts as a counterbalance to the rushing cascade, boldly painted in blue.  The reserved white paper is artfully employed in the highlighted foam of the current.  Touches of Homer's signature red in the foreground water and the fisherman's belt contribute to the picture's visual unity.	

Homer helped found the American Water Color Society in 1865, at a time when the medium was considered the province of women and amateurs.  His strong colors and brilliant execution increased the respect accorded the medium, as did his then daring prediction to a friend, ,You will see, in the future I will live by my watercolors.,

"As early as 1852, Rhode Island businessman Marshall Woods requested from Hiram Powers a pair of busts modeled on the classical ideal. For unknown reasons, Powers did not fulfill Woods original request. The client persisted and fourteen years later Powers finally agreed to the commission as long as it was for three statues. The subjects chosen were modeled on the Christian theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity, which derive from the New Testament verse of 1 Corinthians 13:13: “And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.” Acting on the significance given to charity in the biblical framework, Power’s conception of the group had “Faith “and “Hope “as the flanking works and “Charity “elevated at the center of the triad. Each bust was distinguished from the other through both posture and the use of traditional symbols for their character. The original bust of “Faith “was the second of the trio to be completed in the summer of 1866. Here, she wears a tiara bearing the Greek cross, and her skyward gaze implies that her confidence is derived from heaven above.

Recognized today as the most important American sculptor of neoclassical subjects of his time, Powers was also the first sculptor from the United States to achieve international fame, based in great part on the success of his statue the “The GreekSlave”.

"Bolton Coit Brown uses lines of varying thickness and value to produce the effect of dappled sunlight in this lithograph of a mill in Zena, New York. His energetic style evokes the informality of a pencil sketch, underscoring lithography’s affinity with drawing. To make a lithograph, an artist draws onto a stone with an oily, ink-receptive crayon or other substance. The stone is then inked, rinsed, and pressed onto a piece of paper.

Brown taught himself lithography while staying in London from 1915 to 1916. Prior to World War I, American artists had to have their lithographs printed in Europe, as American printers were primarily interested in printing commercial images. Brown, by contrast, learned to print for himself, allowing him to produce his own lithographs in the United States. He also printed the designs of other American artists, most notably George Bellows. object/4264118"

"Osceola was chief of the Seminoles during the Indian Wars of the 1830s.  Treacherously imprisoned by the U.S. Army under a flag of truce, the 35-year-old warrior died of tuberculosis at Fort Moultrie within months.  Osceola's valor and the circumstances of his last days made him a folk hero and an example of the United States' misguided policy toward the native population. Osceola's features reflect his mixed blood; his paternal grandfather was a Scotsman who married a Creek woman.  In this later copy, Curtis idealized Osceola's features, giving them a distinctly European cast.  His breastplates and beaded belt, contrasted with the cotton shawl and headwrap, underscore the uneasy mixture of Osceola's American Indian and European ancestry. object/4280113"

",Electric Bulb, exemplifies Davis' experimental encounter with Cubism.  His use of oversized objects, portrayed with hard-edged clarity, foreshadowed what Davis would continue to achieve later in his career.  Davis developed and expanded upon a unique analysis of the modern idiom. ,Electric Bulb, is an expression of the American scene, fragmented and recombined as a vividly colored geometric structure.

Between 1916 and 1920, Davis's work underwent a dramatic stylistic change.  He abandoned the expressionistic landscapes and portraits painted in a style reminiscent of Van Gogh in favor of the visual language of cubism, adopting the bold forms and unmodeled planes of color to express the raw energy of postwar America.  In 1923 and 1924, he painted a series of images based on the most common artifacts of modern life--an eggbeater, a saw, and in the Dallas Museum of Art work, a light bulb and its cardboard sleeve.  Davis exaggerated the forms of these industrial objects and colored them brilliantly, creating visual counterparts to the rhythms of the Jazz Age.  These works represent a clean break with traditional still-life painting, exemplifying Davis's comment in 1923 that ,No work of art can be true to nature in the objective sense.  The nearer it approximates the natural appearance of objects the more it is likely to be far away from art., object/4286243"

Their swirling brushwork, broad handling, variety of textures, and, in particular, luscious flesh tones were all trademarks of Stuart's style-and light years ahead of any other American artist at the time.

Philadelphians such as the Ashleys flocked to Stuart, as did sitters during his later stays in the new city of Washington, D.C., and Boston. Unfortunately, Stuart was famously slow to complete his commissions, thus America's most skilled artist remained perpetually broke. object/4299508"

"The young Texas artists in the Allied Arts Exhibition of 1935 demonstrated a marked independence from the prevailing dogma of American Scene painting, abstracting and personalizing their vision rather than adhering to certifiably ,American, styles and narrative themes.  In ,Swollen Stream,, Spruce captures the violence of a Texas spring storm, using clashing angular and spiral forms and a palette of dark, lurid greens. By taking his shapes and colors beyond natural appearances, the artist expresses the emotional effect of nature in its resurgent season. object/4305723"

"In the 1930s,Texas artists recorded not only the distinctive landscape around them but also the changing urban landscape as well. Velma Davis Dozier, a talented painter, watercolorist, printmaker, and jewelry designer, turned her attention to an industrial scene on the edge of downtown Dallas.

A lifelong sustainer of the Dallas Museum of Art together with her husband, Otis Dozier,Velma Davis Dozier left a substantial collection of materials amassed on the couple's many travels, as well as funds for the acquisition of tribal arts and an annual travel fund that allows Texas artists over thirty to broaden their horizons.

"Already a celebrated naval officer, Commodore Isaac Hull captured the nation's attention during the War of 1812, when the U.S. Constitution, under his command, battled and sank the British frigate Guerriere.These portraits do not emphasize Hull's heroism, as did other contemporary examples. Rather, they were undoubtedly family paintings meant to be enjoyed in private. The emphasis on Commodore and Mrs. Hull's appearance, as well as their bust-length compositions and neutral backgrounds, derive from William Dunlap's previous career as a miniaturist, since the small scale of portrait miniatures left little room for fanciful backgrounds.

William Dunlap was not only a portraitist. Much of what we know about early American art comes from his 1834 ,History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design of the United States,, the first history of American art, written by someone who personally knew most of the subjects. object/4321037"

"“While these powers are at work pushing, pulling, sideways, downwards, upwards, I can hear the sound of their strife and there is great music being played. And so I try to express graphically what a great city is doing. Within the frames there must be a balance.”

John Marin’s works, such as ,Park Row,, typically focus on either city or landscape, rarely figures. Like his paintings, Marin’s drawings of New York City are full of dynamism and spontaneity. He began etching on a trip to London in 1905 and continued with the medium throughout his life. object/4335948"

In 1898 he co-founded an artist's colony there, which thrived in the early 20th century. After 1919 the artist and his family moved permanently to Taos. object/4343782"

"Sky Overcast, is one of several images that Louis Lozowick created of telephone wires, is both a naturalistic landscape and an abstract composition. The soft forms of the clouds contrast with the straight black lines of the wires, which bend into unusual angles and shapes. Meanwhile, a single tree in the left corner both grounds and disorients us, prompting us to question our actual vantage point in the landscape.

Originally from a small village in what is now Ukraine, Louis Lozowick immigrated to the United States as a child. During the 1920s, he spent several years in Europe, living in Paris and Berlin. Lozowick became closely associated with the Russian constructivists working in Germany, and their emphasis on technology and abstract geometric forms profoundly influenced his work. Beginning in the 1930s, however, Lozowick also began creating landscapes, exploring the interaction between the natural world and human technology. object/4365156"

"Henry Ossawa Tanner used his Swedish-born wife Jessie and their son Jesse as models for the Virgin and Christ, giving the work a double resonance as both a meditative biblical scene and a tender family portrait.

The first African American artist to obtain international acclaim, Tanner is the last great exponent of religious painting in European and American art. The son of an African Methodist Episcopal minister, Tanner studied with Thomas Eakins at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts before pursuing a career in Paris, where the professional and societal obstacles facing people of color were not as severe as in 19th- and early 20th-century America. Tanner's religious paintings were popular and critical successes at the Salon and with collectors on two continents. object/5000380"

"In 1883 Julian Alden Weir exchanged one of his paintings for about 150 acres of farmland and orchards near Branchville, Connecticut.  He often set out for walks through his fields with his sketching materials, bringing back ideas for paintings.  Weir's frequent guests at Branchville included fellow artists Childe Hassam, John Twachtman, Theodore Robinson, and Albert Pinkham Ryder.

Much of Weir's early work is figurative and closer in feel to the paintings of tonalist artists like Thomas Dewing than to the work of Hassam and the American Impressionists.  It is primarily in his late works that Weir turned to the landscape for his subject.  ,Ravine near Branchville,, with its high horizon and broad, painterly touch, can be dated to the final decade of Weir's life.  Pinholes in each corner of the painting suggest Weir had worked ,en plein air,, tacking the canvas to an easel or other portable support.  Weir's interest was in the play of light and shadow across the ravine, his flickering brushwork mimicking the movement of a light breeze across the leaves and grasses.  As is typical of his late works, the artist confined his palette to shades of blue and green, primarily in pastel tones.  Weir's absorption with the landscape at Branchville may have been his antidote to ever present pressures of official duties related to his participation in two important organizations:  the breakaway Society of American Artists, established in protest of the restrictive guidelines of the National Academy of Design, and The Ten, a group of American impressionist and tonalist painters.

"In 1853, building on the international success of his celebrated statue the ,Greek Slave,, expatriate sculptor Hiram Powers began work in Rome on a full-size allegorical figure called ,America., In contrast to his earlier, nude work, the personification of America wore a tunic and diadem reminiscent of the classical past, linking the young United States with the republics of Greece and Rome, symbolic birthplaces of democracy.

,America, proved so popular with the public that private patrons commissioned at least twenty bust-length reproductions from Powers. The Museum's example is not only one of the earliest busts of ,America, but also the only one signed and dated by Powers. Its polychrome marble base is also original to the piece.

",Suspended Power, depicts a hydraulic turbine being lowered into place at a new hydroelectric power dam in Guntersville, Alabama. It is one of several works by Charles Sheeler exploring the varieties of industrial, mechanical, and natural power in the United States. In 1938 Fortune magazine commissioned the artist to create a series of photographs and paintings on the theme of power that were published in 1940 as a portfolio in the magazine.

Pennsylvania-born and -trained, Sheeler was influenced by abstract works he saw at the Armory Show in New York in 1913. His mature style is one of hard edges, smooth surfaces, and cool tonalities, in the service of seemingly highly realistic representation. Acclaimed for his paintings exploring the American industrial landscape, Sheeler was also an accomplished photographer. object/5040900"
"With his ,shadow boxes,, simple box constructions containing such objects as seashells, bottles, cordial glasses, driftwood, maps, photographs, and surrealist-inspired collages, the reclusive and reticent Joseph Cornell created a private world of transcendent poetic power.  He made these intimate private universes in the simple family home in Queens, New York, where from 1929 on, he lived with his family and worked.  Although he had no formal schooling in art, Cornell cultivated a taste for French literature and a lifelong passion for symbolist painters such as Odilon Redon and the poets Charles Baudelaire and Stéphane Mallarmé.  He had contact during the 1930s with the artistic climate in New York, where many of the city's artists and Europe's expatriate artists frequented the few avant-garde galleries.  At the Julien Levy Gallery, Cornell became involved with many painters and writers connected with the surrealist movement in the United States before and during World War II.  In 1937 he was included in the seminal exhibition ,Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism, at New York's Museum of Modern Art.

Throughout his productive career, which included experimentation with film, Cornell investigated motifs such as hotels, constellations, bees, and Renaissance paintings of children.  In the shadow box ,Grand Hôtel de la Boule d'Or,, letterheads of various hotels and a photographic reproduction of a drawing, ,The Artist's Daughter,, by Jusepe de Ribera, are collaged on the front of aged, faded blue wood; on the back he collaged pages from a French anthology, ,Oeuvres Diverses.,  With grace and subtlety, Cornell combines the everyday and the extraordinary to evoke a Proustian, dreamlike world devoted to old places and possessions—the remembrance of things past.

"This portrait's realism and the sophisticated modeling of light and shadow on the sitter's face make it much finer than virtually anything produced in Texas previously. Its small scale doubtless testifies to the scarcities of artists' materials available in the far reaches of early Texas.

Louisa Wueste was one of the earliest and most accomplished Texas painters. Born in Westphalia, Germany, she studied art at the Düsseldorf Academy, a magnet in the mid-19th century for young American students. In 1859 she immigrated to Texas with her family as one of many German settlers in the state. Wueste worked as a portraitist and landscape painter in San Antonio, Galveston, and Eagle Pass. object/5047857"

"This altarpiece depicts the conversion of St. Paul, one of the fathers of the Christian church. Previously an avid persecutor of Christians, Saul—as he was originally known—was struck by temporary blindness while en route to the city of Damascus. Upon regaining his sight, he changed his name to Paul and became a Christian, going on to become one of the major authors of the New Testament.

This painting served as a model for a painted glass window in St. Paul's Church in Birmingham, England. It is the earliest and smallest of two versions of the subject by Benjamin West.

"This portrait was painted in Seville, Spain, between January and May 1909, during a yearlong study trip that Francis Luis Mora took to Scotland, London, Paris, and several Spanish cities. The work was completed in a rented studio, with a hired model wearing picturesque peasant garb intended to evoke the image of a Spanish gypsy. Mora had wanted to paint outdoors, but unrelenting rain that spring kept the artist inside. As he wrote in his diary at one frustrated moment, ,It feels today more like Scotland in October.,

Francis Luis Mora was born in Uruguay to a Spanish father and French mother who had immigrated to South America. When Mora was three, his sculptor father returned the family temporarily to Barcelona, Spain, before permanently settling in New York in 1880. Mora studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Art Students League in New York with Edmund Charles Tarbell, Frank W. Benson, and William Merritt Chase. During the early 20th century, he enjoyed a long and successful career as a portraitist, popular illustrator, and painter of Spanish-inflected subjects. object/5074675"

One of the first professionally trained artists to work in the state, Ney became a leading figure in late 19th-century Texas art and civic life.

"Over his lifetime, George Bellows executed several portraits of his wife, Emma. The painting ,Emma in a Purple Dress, (currently on the Museum’s fourth level) was his last, and the one that took the longest. He spent several years working and reworking the painting, only finishing in 1923, three years after this preliminary drawing was done. Though the basic composition—the dress and position of the body—remained the same, Bellows did a series of lithographs exploring various possibilities with the head and facial expressions. Emma’s final expression is pensive, though it has been suggested that her averted gaze may be the result of the tedium of innumerable sittings. object/5129918"

"The Owlkill River is a tributary of the Hoosick River in upstate New York, near the farm where Anna Mary Robertson (popularly known as ,Grandma,) Moses lived and worked. Like all of Moses' paintings, this winter scene is a combination of real locations and buildings from her neighborhood, her memories of childhood, and compositions taken from popular prints by the 19th-century lithographers Currier & Ives.

Although she drew as a child, Moses did not begin making pictures until she was in her 70s, after a long life as a farmer in New York and Virginia. She first worked in fabric, and then moved to paint because it was less difficult for her arthritic hands. Through the promotion of several art dealers trumpeting naïve or folk art as an antidote to abstraction, Moses became an overnight sensation in the 1940s. Until her death at 101, Moses produced more than 1,500 paintings over her twenty-year career. object/5143735"

"Gwathmey's career began during the heyday of social realism in the 1930s, and his subsequent work carried with it a range of political and moral comment.  His spare, brightly colored paintings combine harsh realities and poetic inner vision in depicting black farmers of the South.  ,Portrait of a Farmer's Wife, was probably painted around 1951, the year a very similar version, now at the Smithsonian, was executed.  Gwathmey's strong outlines and planes of color aptly convey the woman's dignity, particularly in the timeworn face and the gnarled hands resting squarely upon her knees.  At her side, a humble pot of flowers resting on a twig table expresses the search for small beauties in a lifetime of hard work. object/5153584"

Beyond a cluster of shallow boats in the foreground, we see the open waters of the Pool, a section of the Thames that served as the main port of London in the 19th century. The dense cluster of ships' masts in the distance at left suggests the scale of commercial activity along this part of the river. The boatman seated at his oars in the foreground is rendered with quick, nervous lines that are meant to suggest Rembrandt's approach to the medium of etching. object/5170391"
"Rachel Leeds Kerr was the wife of Lt. David Kerr, a justice of the peace in Talbot, Maryland, and member of the Maryland House of Delegates. Like all of Charles Willson Peale's works, this portrait has a linear quality, featuring strongly marked contour lines and a careful delineation of materials-largely due to Peale's self-taught background, which not even two years' study in London with Benjamin West could totally soften.

Born in Maryland but based in Philadelphia for most of his career, Peale was not only one of early America's most successful artists, he also helped engineer the United States' artistic future. Besides founding the nation's two earliest art academies, he trained virtually every member of his family-especially his children, all named after famous European artists-to become painters, as well. At the Peale Museum in Philadelphia's Independence Hall, the artist exhibited natural history specimens, natural and scientific curiosities, and life portraits of the historical and cultural figures who had led to the creation of the United States. Thus, in both the public and private spheres, Peale was one of the leading figures to promote and disseminate culture in the new United States. object/5170939"

"The jagged, snow-capped peak of the Swiss mountain the Matterhorn grandly looming over a valley of finely detailed pine trees is characteristic of the widely popular landscapes by Albert Bierstadt.The artist executed this scene while spending two years enjoying celebrity in Europe.

During the late 19th century, Bierstadt became famous for his images of the American West, to which he journeyed as part of survey expeditions in 1859 and 1863. Based on firsthand experience but completed with a certain amount of tweaking in the studio, Bierstadt's dramatic landscapes thrilled Eastern U.S. and European audiences hungry for depictions of unfamiliar places.

"This engaging portrait is a combination of close observation and stylized artistic conventions. Sarah Badger Noyes' distinctive facial features and expression, as well as the attention paid to her lace collar and sleeves, testify to the artist's careful study of the model and her clothing. The stylized flower tucked into Noyes' collar and the fruit she holds, however, are most likely props taken from European mezzotint engravings, carrying generic meanings of youth and fertility. Since its discovery, this portrait has been attributed to different artists. Based on the identity of the sitter, as well as the technique, it has most recently been attributed to Noyes' cousin Joseph Badger, a Massachusetts portraitist popular in Boston between the death of John Smibert and the advent of John Singleton Copley. object/5190105"

"The then seventeen–year–old artist Rembrandt Peale painted George Washington from life in 1795, thanks to the intervention of his father, artist Charles Willson Peale. As he remembered later about the seven a.m. appointment with the president,,I was up before daylight and putting everything in the best condition for the sitting with which I was to be honored, but before the hour arrived became so agitated that I could scarcely mix my colors.,

In 1823, long after Washington's death and in response to the enduring popularity of Gilbert Stuart's portrait of the president, Peale revised his original portrait into the present composition, which exists in over seventy examples. Peale idealized Washington's features according to fashionable theories of physiognomy, in which facial proportions acted as signs of character or nobility. He also set the bust of the president into a fictive oval opening recalling both antique sculpture and Renaissance and Baroque state portraiture, perhaps angling for display in the neoclassical interiors of the nation's new Capitol Building. object/5198037"

"Deeply influenced by such visionary painters as Wassily Kandinsky, Marsden Hartley, and Arthur Dove, Jonson sought throughout his career to express the spiritual qualities underlying material appearances. Jonson moved the New Mexico in 1924, where, for the next several decades, he conveyed the sensations engendered by his environment in progressively more abstract form and color, making him something of a ,lone wolf, among the more representational painters of Taos and Santa Fe.

After several difficult years in New Mexico, Jonson experienced in 1929 a sort of spiritual epiphany which ultimately led him to abandon objective sources for his art.  Beginning in the 1930s, his work became more serial in nature as he explored and improvised on certain themes.  ,Variations on Rhythm P, is one of 26 canvases based on the alphabet.  The various curvilinear, stepped, and geometric forms play rhythmically on the letter P, establishing a multilayered space which, in fact, is not intended to represent a physical environment, but rather to express a visual equivalent of this interplay of rhythms. object/5200705"

"Otis Dozier represents the cotton plant in all its stages of growth, from planting to maturity to harvest, imbuing the plant with the symbolism of the life cycle itself. Raised on a cotton ranch near present-day Mesquite, Texas, Dozier pays tribute to the value of the agricultural product that once sustained the state of Texas until the domination of oil and ranching after World War II. This painting was exhibited at the 1936 Texas Centennial.

After training in Dallas at the Aunspaugh Art School and the Dallas Art Institute, and with Frank Reaugh, Dozier himself taught for years at Southern Methodist University and at the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts (where the legacy left by him and his wife, artist Velma Davis Dozier, provides an annual travel prize to emerging artists as well as acquisition funds for tribal art). An inveterate traveler, his interests and collections encompassed the art of many cultures.

,Evening Wind, was first exhibited in 1920 in Los Angeles and New York at the National Academy of Design.

The nickname stuck within the family and ,Cosy, became the subject of over a dozen portraits that trace her journey from infancy to adulthood. This example depicts her as a pensive twelve or thirteen year old.

When asked the reason for his frequent use of his daughter as a subject, the artist claimed, ,Why? I don't know.

While containing recognizable elements, such as the blimp with the Mobil Pegasus symbol and the apartment building itself, the relationships among the images, especially the apartment dwellers and the fictive advertisements outside and near it, remain mysterious and unclear.

Koerner’s juxtaposition of several types of representation in a highly finished style is called magic realism. Beginning with this painting, the artist frequently used imagery of brides and grooms—here posed for by Edna and Harris Goldberger, friends of the painter. object/5257852"

Objects signifying the transience of the natural world dot the composition, such as the vase with dying flowers atop the table, and the powder and makeup pots Ida uses in vain.

Williams.,  ,Commodore Trunnion and Jack Hatchway, was the first canvas shown under Edmonds's name, and was widely considered equal to the work of the great American genre painter, William Sidney Mount.  The scene is taken from an 18th-century English novel by Tobias Smollet, ,The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle,, in which Jack Hatchway learns from the newspaper that the Commodore's rival, Admiral Bower, has been designated a peer of the realm.  The setting has been moved from the original tavern to the Commodore's workroom, and Edmonds chose the quiet moment just before Jack happens upon the bad news.  The skillfully rendered flagon in its straw casing, the pewter tankard, and the block and tackle reflect Edmonds's admiration for the 17th-century Dutch tradition of still-life and genre painting. object/5279396"

In the 1880s, Whistler's etchings and drypoints tended to be smaller and simpler, with less fine detail and surface tone than his earlier prints. His prints of this decade are characterized by abbreviated, expressive lines. Whistler's last etchings showcase his command of the medium with richness and variety.

Whistler maintained that because the etcher's needle was small, the etching should also be small. He also insisted no margin should be left outside the plate mark; after 1880 he trimmed etchings to the plate mark, leaving only a tab for his signature in the form of a butterfly. object/5292980"

But more recent events also mark this canvas: specifically, the U.S. war with Mexico between 1846 and 1848. Astute viewers would have recognized the anachronistic combination of Revolutionary War battle sites painted on the sides of the wagon and the modern U.S. Army symbol branded on the horse's flank.

North Carolinian Ranney had experienced battle firsthand as a veteran of the Texas war for independence, in which he enlisted the week after the fall of the Alamo.

In the biblical story, a headstrong young man goes out into the world to seek his fortune and falls into vice. When he returns home broken and battered, he is welcomed by his father. As an example of the limitless possibilities of forgiveness, the story has resonated for centuries. Like the Prodigal Son, Benton returned from New York to his native Missouri to teach art; however, unlike his subject, Benton’s homecoming was not as happy, as suggested in the bleak landscape and ominous atmosphere of this painting. object/5303880"
"Jesse James and his brother Frank were legendary as contemporary Robin Hoods who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. Here they are shown robbing a bank and a train. To add to the image’s realism, Thomas Hart Benton used Dan James, a descendant of the James lineage, as the model for the foreground figure. Benton was pleased enough with the outcome to issue one hundred prints of the lithograph ,Jesse James, through the Associated American Artists Galleries in New York. object/5304437"

"When wealthy Philadelphia merchant Paul Beck, Jr., decided to commission portraits of himself and his second wife, Mary Harvey, the choice of Thomas Sully was an obvious one. Every detail, from the curve of the sofa on which Mrs. Beck's arm rests to her high-waisted gown and curls à la grecque, as well as the neutral background, reveals Sully's mastery of the neoclassical taste so popular in Federal Philadelphia.

Two years earlier, fresh from studies with Gilbert Stuart in Boston and Sir Thomas Lawrence in London, the young artist had caused a sensation in Philadelphia. Sully's rapid execution and sheer facility with the brush made him the toast of the town-and the successor to the elderly Gilbert Stuart, who had previously been the splashiest, finest portraitist available in the young republic.

"The American artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler is generally credited with spurring the Etching Revival, an artistic movement that flourished in Britain and France during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The artists of the Etching Revival sought to renew etching as a form of original artistic expression rather than mere reproduction. Their graphic work not only looked back to the open, painterly style of Rembrandt and his generation but demonstrated a modern sensibility in the choice of subject matter. object/5307390"

"Carved from a single block of marble, this imposing statue of a brooding queen is a fictional portrait of Semiramis (seh-MIR-ah-miss), queen of Assyria around 800 B.C. Although a historical figure, by the late 19th century Semiramis had become the stuff of legend: an ambitious woman who seized power through the murder of her husband, before being killed by her own estranged son. This view was popularized through the French philosopher Voltaire's 1784 play and the Italian composer Rossini's 1822 opera, both of which helped inspire William Wetmore Story's composition.

In his portrait of Semiramis, Story combined the monumental scale, idealized features, and classical drapery of European neoclassicism with historically accurate details of hairstyle and jewelry meant to evoke the ancient Near East. Like many 19th-century sculptors, Story made the clay maquette, or model, himself, while a team of trained Italian carvers produced the final marble sculptures under his supervision. Two versions of this statue exist: this example, made for the American collector William Blodgett, and another at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia.

The son of a Supreme Court justice, William Wetmore Story became one of the leading artists of an expatriate colony of American sculptors in Rome during the second half of the 19th century. He specialized in portraits of legendarily troubled women who lived lives of political intrigue and psychological and sexual drama, such as Semiramis, the doomed Egyptian queen Cleopatra, and the notorious Greek Medea, who murdered her own children. object/5321726"

"The warm tones and profusion of meticulously rendered fruits spilling forth recall the grand still-life tradition of 17th–century Dutch painting. Always popular with collectors in Europe and America, still lifes were well-suited to the grand interiors of the luxurious homes being built in the prosperous city of Williamsport, Pennsylvania.

Located in the north–central part of the state, Williamsport had an abundance of lumber that gave it more millionaires per capita than any other locale, making it a lucrative market for an enterprising artist such as Severin Roesen, who immigrated to the United States from Germany during the Revolution of 1848.

"Born in Indian Territory in what is now Oklahoma, Leon Polk Smith was trained in New York and France. In the 1930s, he came to know the work of Constantin Brancusi, Jean Arp, and Piet Mondrian. His own works adopted geometric abstraction and a nonobjective vocabulary. Smith was not particularly interested in Mondrian’s theories but responded to the visual impact of his grid and the sense of extension beyond the edge of the canvas.

In fact, Polk Smith never met Mondrian; nonetheless, in 1946 he painted several works in tribute to him, beginning with this work, Homage to Victory Boogie Woogie #1. It is interesting that Smith chose an unfinished Mondrian and one that was begun in New York as the point of departure for his homage. His own work is not confined by any strict rules concerning color and line; rather the floating color planes imply a response to the urban landscape, a dizzying bird’s-eye view, perhaps, from the height of a skyscraper. object/5322461"
"Norman Rockwell’s illustrations for such magazines as the ,Saturday Evening Post, and ,Look, have become icons of American culture. ,Law Student, appeared on the cover of the February 19, 1927, issue of the ,Post., In honor of Abraham Lincoln’s 118th birthday, Rockwell depicted a young man in the midst of study. The two pictures of Lincoln behind him indicate his aspiration to follow in “Honest Abe’s” footsteps. Rockwell’s message is clear: just as Lincoln overcame long odds to become president, so too could anybody with a strong, honest work ethic.

"An eerie stillness permeates this midwestern landscape by John Rogers Cox. Every feature is rendered with unusual clarity, from the grass in the foreground to the clouds suspended above the field. Yet the scene appears devoid of any human presence, an absence that underscores the image’s uncanny character.

Cox is associated with regionalism, an American artistic movement that was especially popular during the 1930s. Regionalists usually preferred rural subjects and worked in a naturalistic style. The uncanny quality of Cox’s meticulous style, however, is also exemplary of magic realism, a stylistic tendency that developed in both Europe and America after World War I, though it was never a unified movement. Reacting against the abstract painting that had occurred during the early 20th century, magic realist artists depicted seemingly everyday subjects in a hyper–realistic manner, giving their works an eerie, seemingly magical quality. object/5323505"

"Myron Stout is, like James Brooks, a Texas native who claimed a significant spot in the arena of post-war New York abstract art.  Stout, a native of Denton, studied at North Texas State University and taught briefly in San Antonio.  He earned a Master's Degree at Columbia University Teacher's College and moved on a permanent basis to New York in 1937.  Until 1950 he split his time between New York and Provincetown, where he then lived year-round.

Stout is best known for his small to moderate-scaled black and white paintings and very small charcoal, conté crayon and graphite drawings, each with astonishingly rich surfaces and deceptively simple forms.  His images are distilled and highly concentrated, elemental shapes or structures.  His process can best be described as meticulous, each work labored over on and off for months or even years.  Stout achieved thereby a powerful sense of density or weight, a tension between form and void, an uncanny spatial ambiguity.

Untitled was painted in the 1950's, years during which Stout studied in the summers at Hans Hofmann's school in Provincetown.  The painting's vibrant color and sense of directional intensity or energy surely reveals Hofmann's impact.  There is a tremendous optical vibration resulting from Stout's careful choice of color, ranging from yellow to pale orange to saturated orange or near red to an uncommon hot pink.  The small blocks of blue amplify the optical vibration and reinforce the sense of upward flow or motion.  Despite the clear influence of Hofmann, Stout seems never to have been tempted by the gestural expressionism of many of his contemporary abstract colleagues. object/5325525"
"The straining, athletic forms of this rare marble composition exemplify the importance of the human figure in motion for Malvina Hoffman. Throughout her long and distinguished career, Hoffman chose the body as her focus. She studied sculpture for a year in Paris with Auguste Rodin, who impressed upon her the necessity to master all technical processes of her art.

Extended close study of her subjects marked all of Hoffman's work, whether her first successes capturing the performances of ballet legends or her best-known project, the 1930 commission for the Hall of Man at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History. The Chicago work includes approximately 104 sculptures of subjects of all ethnicities, taken from five years of global travel. object/5325825"
"Mansion on the Beach is one of several woodcuts that Lyonel Feininger made of a beachside scene that he had sketched while visiting Heringsdorf, a German seaside area near the Polish border. In each of these woodcuts, Feininger transforms the original landscape into a dynamic, abstract composition. Hills, clouds, and trees become angular shapes, while straight and diagonal lines add energy and movement. Feininger’s geometric style reflects the influence of expressionism and other abstract movements that flourished in early 20th-century Germany. 

Originally from New York, Feininger spent most of his artistic career in Berlin. He first gained recognition as a cartoonist, but later became a teacher and master printmaker at the Bauhaus, one of the most important schools of design of the 20th century. Primarily a painter, Feininger began making woodcuts during World War I, when wartime conditions made oil paints difficult to obtain. object/5325916"
",I first put down several rectangles of color. Then I might paste a photograph, say, anything just to get me started. I try to move up and down the canvas, always moving up and across.What I'm trying to do then is establish a vertical and a horizontal control of the canvas.,
--Romare Bearden

Fragments of painted paper, magazine and newspaper images, references to African masks, and printed copies of fabrics animate the surface of Romare Bearden's collage of three musicians, giving it a sense of movement and rhythm. Perhaps based on his memories of friends playing music in Pittsburgh or New York City, this work is one of many celebrating musicians produced over the artist's forty-year career.

One of the great collage artists of the 20th century, Bearden strikes an eloquent balance between the subject matter and artistic styles of modern art, the cultural history of Africa, and the rich complexities of African-American life. object/5325934"

"In the late 1830s, in response to financial problems, Thomas Sully began to create ,fancy pictures, of literary and sentimental subjects for the open market. This painting-one of the largest and most successful of them-illustrates the fairy tale ,Cinderella, or the Little Glass Slipper, by Charles Perrault. First published in France in 1692 and a perennial favorite in English translation after 1729, Cinderella is the story of a beautiful girl mistreated by her family who ultimately wins a prince with a little help from her fairy godmother. Clad in a simple yet beautifully painted gown, Sully's charming heroine plays with her cat at the hearth, while her stepsisters primp in the background in preparation for the royal ball. A success when it was exhibited in Philadelphia in 1844 and Baltimore in 1848, the painting displays the delicate glazes, rosy palette, and fluid brushwork that were trademarks of Sully's dazzling style, combined with a popular subject familiar to generations of viewers. object/5326520"

"Edmund C. Tarbell's family were frequent subjects for his paintings. Here, he depicts his wife, Emeline, with their oldest child, fifteen-year-old Josephine. Stripped of excess, uncomplicated by detail or distracting elements, the painting is a mesmerizing representation of two closely observed loved ones. The intimate pose of mother and daughter, the exquisitely soft handling of paint, and the deep luminosity of the surface all combine to great effect in this highly personal work.

One of the most important portraitists in New England, Tarbell was also a member of the Ten American Painters, a group of American artists who broke away from New York's Society of American Artists in order to organize their own, non-juried exhibitions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. object/5326803"
"The complex surface of this portrait is due to Charles Webster Hawthorne’s experimentation with technique.The artist mixed varnish directly into the oil paint in between applications of glazes, which resulted in a textured, mottled surface that adds to the ethereal nature of this idealized portrait. This process, however, threatens the stability and appearance of the painting over time.

A devoted pupil and studio assistant of William Merritt Chase, Hawthorne founded his own summer art program in Provincetown, Massachusetts, in the early 20th century. He became one of the leading painters in the famed artists’ colony, known particularly for his portraits of the fishermen along Cape Cod. object/5327014"

"The portrait of Mrs. Sims is a marvelous example of 18th century portraiture as practiced in Europe and imported into America by ambitious itinerant painters. The detail of the sitter's highly finished coiffure, Empire-waist gown, and embroidered cloak attests to the artist's skill, as do the bold scarlet accents playing against the cool, neutral background.

Sweden's most successful 18th-century painter, Adolf Ulric Wertmüller trained at the Royal Academy in Stockholm but made his career in France. The changing political climate of the 1790s forced the expatriate painter abroad to Spain and finally to Philadelphia in 1794. Once settled in the cultural capital of the United States, Wertmüller painted George Washington, as well as other notable Philadelphia sitters. object/5327307"
"This small portrait of a fashionable Creole gentleman is attributed to Julien Hudson, one of the earliest documented free artists of color working in New Orleans. In the 19th century, a sizable prosperous community of free people of color flourished in the city, and many of them worked as artists and craftspeople or ran successful businesses.

The portrait's small scale reflects Hudson's initial training as a miniaturist, while the stark background and precise handling combine the influence of his study in Paris between 1829 and 1831 and his relationship with European artists working in New Orleans in the 1830s, such as Jean-Joseph Vaudechamp and François Fleischbein. object/5328623"
"A Colorado mining town becomes an exploration in color, shape, and memory for Doris Lee in this charming painting executed while the artist was in residency at the Colorado Springs Art Center. Lee plays off her location's name, combining tangible figures and animals with partially materialized phantoms, witnessed especially by the tiny figure of a ghostly prospector and his pack animal on a ridge in the right background. The bold color relationships of the houses and the simple patterns of the mountains in the background also add to the painting's immediate visual appeal.

At the middle of the 20th century, Lee was one of America's most popular representational artists. Although her work appeared deceptively simple and reminiscent of folk art, she was a successful teacher and a highly trained painter who had studied in Europe. Besides painting, Lee designed backdrops for the original Broadway production of the musical Oklahoma! object/5328844"

"This intimate portrait of the artist François Fleischbein’s wife was painted in New Orleans after the German-born painter and his French wife settled there in the mid-1830s. The work displays his winning combination of precise, tight brushwork in the French academic style and a sweetness and charm common to 19th-century German painting.

Fleischbein was born in Bavaria and studied in Paris before joining the community of international painters seeking fame and fortune in cosmopolitan New Orleans. Although born “Franz Josef,” he changed his name to the French “François” to fit in with his Creole clients of Gallic descent. After arriving in New Orleans in 1833, he spent the rest of his life there, working not only as a portrait painter but also
as an early photographer, an enterprise in which Mme Fleischbein also took part. object/5329056"

"The portrait of Dorothy Roosevelt was executed in 1901-1902, when John White Alexander returned to the United States from his most recent ten-year European stay.The sitter was the first cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt and was soon to marry Langdon Geer. The portrait effortlessly demonstrates all the qualities that put Alexander in demand. The simplicity of the composition-a solitary seated figure accompanied by a dog-allows for a focus on Miss Roosevelt, whose grace is emphasized by the sweeping brushwork that defines her tall, elegant figure. Yet the oblique gaze and profile view remove this painting from the straightforward depiction of a particular sitter and position it as a study in reverie.

John White Alexander was a truly cosmopolitan painter whose mature career is a synthesis of the major stylistic trends affecting late 19th-century American art. He studied in both Paris and Munich and subsequently became friends with the expatriate American artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler, whose influence may be seen in the mysterious slightly melancholy nature of this portrait. Alexander was also widely acclaimed as a muralist and illustrator.

"The daughter of a captain in the French and Indian Wars, Ann Langdon married Dr. Richard Ayscough, a New York surgeon, in 1755, the probable date of this portrait. Besides the characteristic attention paid to Ann Langdon's fashionable dress, her sweetly placid expression and slanted, almond-shaped eyes are also typical devices of the artist, who accentuated his American subjects' features to conform to London standards of fashion. The basket of flowers Mrs. Ayscough carries is a standard prop that alludes to women's beauty and fertility, while the feathery park setting in the background exemplifies the same type of handling Thomas Gainsborough would make famous in England a decade later.

Born in England, John Wollaston's career in the colonies was wide-ranging. Between 1749 and 1767, he painted over 300 portraits during successful residencies in New York, Philadelphia, Maryland, Virginia, the British West Indies, and Charleston. Known in particular for his facility with rendering materials, Wollaston pleased an appreciative American audience hungry for high-style goods that emulated those of the motherland. object/5330338"
"New research re-identifies the painter of this rare work and the sitter.

Once thought to be a portrait of Anthony Rutgers by Pieter Vanderlyn, this painting has recently been firmly reattributed to Gerardus Duyckinck. Based on stylistic analysis, baptismal records, genealogical research, and common sense, the sitter has been re-identified as Anthony's son, Petrus. The portrait shows Petrus Rutgers in an authoritative yet comfortable pose, with one glove casually grasped in his left hand. A hazy landscape can be seen through an opening to his right. The composition is based on that of British mezzotints, a practice shared by numerous colonial painters, from the Duyckincks all the way to John Singleton Copley, often with full cooperation from the sitters.

The Duyckincks were a family of painters and artisans working in New York across four generations. By 1731, at age thirty-six, Gerardus Duyckinck was listed as a freeman of the City of New York (meaning he had finally completed his apprenticeship). In 1735 he advertised in the New-York Weekly Journal:

,Lookin-glasses new Silvered, and the Frames plaine Japan'd or Flowered, also all sorts of Picktures, made and Sold, all manner of painting Work done. Likewise Lookinglasses, and all sorts of 	painting Coullers and Oyl sold at reasonable Rates, by Gerardus Duyckinck at the Sign of the two Cupids, near the Old Slip Market. N.B.Where you may have ready Money for old Lookinglasses,

The advertisement testifies to the multitasking required of working artists in the 18th century, who could not depend upon portraiture alone. object/5330339"
"This remarkably detailed view of early 19th-century Brooklyn is of Francis Guy's neighborhood, seen from his studio on Front Street. It is also one of the largest and finest surviving examples of the topographical tradition of American landscape, a school of painting focused on describing the cities and views of the young republic. The businesses and homes along Front, James, and Fulton streets were so clearly identified that a reviewer for the Columbian magazine in May 1820 enthusiastically praised the accuracy of the various compositions (Guy painted at least three similar Brooklyn views):,The stables, barn, and old back buildings of Mr.Titus stand well contrasted with the handsome buildings of Messrs. Sands, Graham, and Birdsall, &c.,

Guy, a London silk-dyer, came to the United States in September 1795 to continue his career in New York and Baltimore. After a 1799 fire destroyed his business, Guy became a full-time painter, despite having no formal artistic training. With the assistance of patrons such as Baltimore's noted early collector Robert Gilmor, who allowed him to copy pictures, Guy developed a charming, distinctive set of views of landmarks around Baltimore. After moving to Brooklyn in 1817, he mounted his most ambitious exhibition, which included this painting, in 1820 at the Shakespeare Club. Sadly, Guy died before the run of the exhibition had finished. William Dunlap, the father of American art history, who met Guy in 1806, wrote dismissively in 1834: ,He attracted some attention by his attempts at landscape painting, and finally made it his profession and found employers. . . . His style was crude and harsh, with little to recommend his efforts, which now would not be tolerated., Critical opinion, however, has warmed, and today Guy is highly regarded as one of America's earliest and most important landscape artists. object/5330668"
"At first glance the two children in this portrait might seem to be girls, due to their long, braided hair and sweet expressions. They are actually boys. The cut of the children's shirts and long pants are too masculine to be 19th-century girls' riding habits, although the materials-deep crimson velvet shirts and white trousers-are too costly and fine to have ever been intended for actual use by active boys. The conspicuous elegance of the attire and fanciful hairstyles of these two brothers indicate they are members of a high social class. The opulence of this portrait, the obvious social standing of its subjects, its grandiose scale, and the elaborate carved and gilded frame all suggest that it may in fact be a portrait of the children of a French count that Jean-Joseph Vaudechamp is listed as having exhibited at the Salon of 1842 in Paris.

After having enjoyed a decade-long, extremely lucrative career painting portraits in New Orleans, the French-born Vaudechamp returned to Paris, where he was able to pick and choose both his French clients and the traveling Creoles who still sought him out, thanks to his successful Louisiana sojourn. object/5330810"

"Like many of his contemporaries, David Johnson made a close study of the regions surrounding the area of the Hudson River at West Point. In “View from Garrison, West Point, New York, “Johnson lays out below us a panoramic view of the river valley where the United States Military Academy at West Point is at the heart of this topographically accurate composition. Gradual transitions of color from dark to light and between wilderness and settled spaces combine with the driving element of the Hudson River to achieve two results: moving the viewer through the work and striking a harmonic balance between the handiworks of man and the natural wonders of the scene. The artist’s concern for all of the intimate details is an invitation to close observation—from the boats that ply the waters of the Hudson at left, to the train that races southward across the railway viaduct at right. 

Johnson, a leading member of the second generation of Hudson River school painters, executed this work in the distinctive style of his middle career, a period characterized by a tightly controlled brushwork, rich color, and masterful compositional structures. His highly refined technique and sheer application of paint during this period achieve a heightened lucidity and luminosity that finds its closest correspondence in the work of John F. Kensett, who is also represented in this gallery.
