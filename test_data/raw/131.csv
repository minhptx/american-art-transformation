"A young boy sits cross-legged with a sundial in the form of a scroll resting in his lap.  This scroll is marked with lines, including directional coordinates, which allow it to be used as a sundial.  Underneath this scroll are bouquets of roses.  His proper right hand, which is in contact with his head, once held a twig that had a wire attached at the end that then connected to the base of the statue.  On this line once was a spider, which apparently was used as part of the sundial.  He rests on an oval base. object/1119"

"Evening ensemble consisting of a dress of silk jersey embroidered with gold sequins and a coat of vicuna lined with silk jersey embroidered with sequins. The sleeveless dress has a slightly blouson bodice, set in waistband and straight sheath skirt. The coat has a tubular silhouette with vertical darts, patch pockets and long narrow sleeves. The ensemble was constructed first and then embroidered with sequins by hand, each sequin sewn twice to assure that they lay flat and do not catch on each other. object/3184"

"A conservation work request form listed the support as ,canvas board,; Leland Howard's Otto Stark book listed it as ,artist's board, (and presumably received this information from the IMA); old IMA labels in the historical file also use ,artist's board., Rebecca McNamara, Curatorial Coordinator, checked the painting itself but it looks to be painted on an unknown surface and then adhered to artist's board - this is possibly a thin piece of board attached to a thicker board. Ellen Lee, Senior Curator, approved change to ,oil on board, but the painting should be reviewed by Conservation at some point to further clarify the support. object/11401"

"Realistic portrait of a reclining Native American female on a painted mat over a bearskin with right elbow placed on a pile of furs and beaded artifacts butted against a ceramic jar with head resting on right hand.  She is  wearing beaded skins which drape off the left shoulder revealing 3/4 of the left breast.  Her long black braids are fastened with beading ties.  The left arm is resting extended along the left ribs, hip, and thigh.  A diminished fire on painterly brown earth trickles blue smoke in the foreground in front of a bowl with spoon.  Musical instruments, weapons, tools, and paintings adorn the cave wall and are strewn about the mat.  A painted satchel sits behind the mat near her extended left moccasin. object/19744"

"Prior to Jan. 12, 2016, EMU stated that the appliques were linen; however, the 12/12/1990 conservation report stated that all materials were cotton. The original gift consideration form and a 2000 wall label also stated that the quilt contained only cotton. Textile and Fashion Arts Curator approved removing ,linen, from list of materials. Possibly more research by textile conservator needed to confirm again? object/24363"

"A non-functional fiber bowl; the piece is composed of various black, brown and gray linen yarns, fine copper wire and what appears to be a sheer black Japanese paper-like material.  The bowl was created by layering adhesive coated materials over a form.  None of the elements are interwoven; rather they are adhered together with an adhesive or sizing.  The body of the bowl is diaphanous and somewhat stiff.  The various ,warp, yarns and wires forming the structure of the bowl extend into a fringe that surrounds the top edge. object/66427"

"The silk chiffon garment is shaped in the form of a kaftan with two large arm lengths which are hidden in the dress silhouette and are not completely visible until the garment is on a form. The entire garment is composed of the two-layer front and back lengths of silk chiffon which are seamed together at the proper left and right sides above and below open rhinestone-lined armholes. The dress is composed of two separate layers of silk chiffon that have a range of blue-ish gray color. The range of colors begins with the lightest blue on the proper right side and extends to a dark bluish-gray on the proper left side when viewed from the front. The added rhinestones are sewn to both layers of the silk chiffon making some more vibrant than others depending on which layer these rhinestones are attached to. 

When viewed from the front, the rhinestones that are part of the ,body, of the garment are attached to the bottom layer but are still quite visible. These rhinestones are laid out in a pattern that extends from the neck of the garment with increasing space between rhinestones the further away they are from the neckline. In addition to the ,body, of the textile, rhinestones outline the armholes and neckline of the garment. These rhinestones are placed closely together and form a triple linear outline of these areas of the garment. They are part of the exterior layer of silk chiffon and are more vibrant than the previously described rhinestones. This same pattern of rhinestone placement can be seen from the back as well. The side seams of the silk chiffon are (machined?) stitched with light blue thread in a                        pattern. The bottom hem is turned up and (hand?) stitched in a pattern. Different shades of blue thread were used to correspond to the different shades of silk chiffon. The hem line is uneven across the bottom of the dress and this is visible when seen in close proximity. object/66535"

"This screen consists of carvings from India collected by Mr. Lockwood de Forest and assembled to suggest a palace façade of that country.  In Bombay, Ahmedabad, and other Indian cities, are old houses in great number, with elaborate and beautiful carved fronts.  Almost the entire upper part of this screen is from such a house front in Ahmedabad.  Carvers in India are all of the Mistre or carpenter cast, and all, even the lowest of them in remote villages, seem born with a remarkable instinct for this art.  The children begin to learn the trade at three years old.  Boys of eight to twelve years carve nearly as well as the men.  The details of the carvings evolve as the carver works.  Only a few leading lines are sketched on the wood before the cutting begins.  Parts of this collection are ancient originals, others are accurate copies made by Indian workmen.  Some stone panels, pierced brasses and inlays are also included. object/84498"
